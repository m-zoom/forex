🔄 User Experience Flow: From Launch to Trading
🟢 1. Easy Onboarding
First-time users are guided with a simple walkthrough:

What the system does

How to interpret pattern alerts

How to set up notifications and preferences

Tooltips or short videos explain key concepts (like "What is a Head and Shoulders pattern?")

📈 2. Real-Time Chart Monitoring
Once logged in, users are shown a live price chart (candlestick style) of selected currency pairs.

A panel allows switching between currency pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/JPY).

As patterns form, the AI overlays them visually on the chart.

E.g., shaded triangle or annotated “Head and Shoulders” with arrows.

🧠 Smart Design Tip: Keep the UI minimal with optional toggles for power users. No clutter.

🔔 3. Intelligent, Non-Intrusive Alerts
When a pattern is detected:

A non-intrusive popup appears on the chart.

Notification sound (optional).

Alert stored in alert history.

Example:

💡 Pattern Detected!
“Double Bottom” on EUR/USD
Confidence: 91% | Suggest: BUY
🔗 View Pattern | 📈 Analyze Further

⚙️ 4. Custom User Preferences
Users can control:

Which patterns to monitor (e.g., ignore pennants, focus on Head & Shoulders).

Minimum confidence threshold (e.g., only alert >80% confidence).

Preferred currency pairs.

Notification method: in-app, email, Telegram, SMS.

Timeframes: 5-min, 15-min, hourly, daily.

🧠 Smart Design Tip: Save settings in user profile so they persist across sessions.

🧾 5. Actionable Insight Panel
When a pattern is clicked:

Show AI’s analysis of what the pattern means.

Historical performance of similar patterns.

Suggested next action (e.g., wait for confirmation candle, place limit order).

Snapshot of the pattern on chart.

📊 6. Pattern History & Analytics
A dashboard tab includes:

List of all patterns detected (date, pair, pattern, confidence, outcome).

Graphs showing:

Accuracy over time.

Best-performing pattern types.

Currency pairs with most frequent patterns.

🧪 7. Backtesting Mode
Advanced users can:

Choose a past date range + currency pair.

Run the AI on that historical data.

See which patterns would have been detected and how profitable they were.

🧠 8. Learn Mode (Optional but Valuable)
To educate users and build trust:

Each pattern alert links to a short explanation:

“What is this pattern?”

“How reliable is it?”

“How often does it succeed?”

Maybe even simulate the next likely price movement.
